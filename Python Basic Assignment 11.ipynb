    "Ques 2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different (that is, 'hello' and 'hello' are considered the same, and 'goodbye' and 'GOODbye' are also considered the same).\n",

    "Ques 4. What are the two lines that must be present in your software in order to call logging.debug()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: To be able to call logging.debug(), you must have these two lines at the start of your program:\n",

    "\n",
    "Ques 7. What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ques 8. Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: We can disable logging messages without removing the logging function calls. We can selectively disable lower-level logging messages. We can create logging messages. Logging messages provides a timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ques 9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The Step button will move the debugger into a function call. The Over button will quickly execute the function call without stepping into it. The Out button will quickly execute the rest of the code until it steps out of the function it currently is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ques 10. After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Continuing means resuming program execution until your program completes normally. it will only stop when it reaches a breakpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ques 11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A breakpoint is a setting on a line of code that causes the debugger to pause when the program execution reaches the line."
